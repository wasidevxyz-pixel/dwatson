    // Heritage, Founders & Family Leadership
    aboutShort: "For nearly five decades, D. Watson has stood as Pakistan's premier healthcare and retail legacy, established by the Bakhtawari family with an unwavering commitment to 100% authentic medicines, global luxury beauty, optics, surgical care, and supermarket convenience.",
    aboutHistory: "The story of D. Watson is rooted in a heartfelt tribute of gratitude. In 1978, three brothers — Chairman Zafar Iqbal Bakhtawari, Co-Chairman Zahid Bakhtawari, and CEO Abid Bakhtawari — established their first pharmacy. The name 'D. Watson' was chosen in deep appreciation of Dr. Watson, the renowned British eye specialist in England who successfully cured Mr. Bakhtawari's eye illness and restored his eyesight during his youth. In 1982, the brothers inaugurated their landmark store in Islamabad's F-6 Super Market, setting a new benchmark for pharmacy retail. The legacy and nationwide expansion continues through the next generation of the Bakhtawari family: Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari (Managing Director, son of Chairman Zafar Iqbal Bakhtawari), Bilal Zahid Bakhtawari (Director, son of Co-Chairman Zahid Bakhtawari), and Haris Bakhtawari & Salman Bakhtawari (Directors, sons of CEO Abid Bakhtawari) — leading D. Watson across 25+ modern branches in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, and Abbottabad.",
